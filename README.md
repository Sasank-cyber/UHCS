🏫 AI-Powered Smart Hostel Management System

A privacy-first, AI-driven system to intelligently manage hostel complaints and attendance, designed specifically for Indian college hostels.

📌 Problem Statement

Traditional hostel management systems suffer from:

First-come-first-serve complaint handling that ignores urgency

Manual, time-consuming attendance processes

Proxy attendance and lack of transparency

Poor visibility for wardens and administrators

💡 Solution Overview

This project provides an integrated, deployable hostel management system that:

Automatically prioritizes complaints using NLP and Explainable AI

Prevents proxy attendance without biometrics or surveillance

Provides transparent decision-making for administrators

Priority scoring based on:

Urgency (water, electricity, safety, etc.)

Severity

Repetition / frequency

Location

Time sensitivity

Auto-escalation of critical and repeated complaints

Explainable AI: each priority score is clearly justified

Attendance allowed only when:

Connected to hostel Wi-Fi

Using a registered device

Within a strict time window
