A privacy-first, AI-driven system to intelligently manage hostel complaints and attendance, designed specifically for Indian college hostels.

Traditional hostel management systems suffer from:

First-come-first-serve complaint handling that ignores urgency

Manual, time-consuming attendance processes

Proxy attendance and lack of transparency

Poor visibility for wardens and administrators

Automatically prioritizes complaints using NLP and Explainable AI

Prevents proxy attendance without biometrics or surveillance

Provides transparent decision-making for administrators
