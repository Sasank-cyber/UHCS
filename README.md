🧠 Problem We Solve

Traditional hostel systems:

Handle complaints first-come-first-serve

Miss urgent safety issues

Rely on manual attendance

Use invasive tracking methods

UHCS fixes this by:

Prioritizing complaints based on urgency, severity, repetition, category, time & location

Auto-escalating critical and repeated issues

Explaining why an issue is high priority (transparent AI)

Allowing attendance only via hostel Wi-Fi + registered device

Flagging suspicious attendance using AI anomaly detection
